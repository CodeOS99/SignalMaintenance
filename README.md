# Signal Maintenance
Signal Maintenance is a game on the theme Signal. You use your antenna to funnel a signal and then resolve that signal by playing one of (currently) 2 minigames.


WASD to move

shift to sprint

space to jump

Red signal - not collected

Green signal  - collected

everything else is a bit obvious

(A thing or two is messed up in the web version; nothing too serious but I have a video demo as well just in case)
